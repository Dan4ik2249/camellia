We are tormented by spiritual thirst,
In the gloomy desert I dragged myself, â€”
And the six - winged seraphim
He appeared to me at a crossroads.
Fingers as light as a dream
He touched my eyes.
Prophetic eyes opened,
Like a frightened eagle.
He touched my ears,
And they were filled with noise and ringing:
And I heard the sky shudder,
And the flight of the angels on high,
And the bastard of the sea is an underwater passage,
And the vines are vegetating.
And he clung to my mouth,
And tore out my sinful tongue,
And idle and crafty,
And the sting of the wise snake
Into my frozen mouth
He put it with his bloody right hand.
And he cut my chest with a sword,
And took out a trembling heart,
And the coal burning with fire,
He pushed the hole into his chest.
Like a corpse in the desert I lay,
And the voice of God called to me:
"Arise, Prophet, and see, and hearken,
Be fulfilled by my will,
And, bypassing the seas and lands,
Use the verb to burn people's hearts."
